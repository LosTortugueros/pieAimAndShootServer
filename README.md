====================

First the Server ask for the adress of the phone
And then listen for ReturnKey in the standard input
Ok maybe it's not a piece of art but hey it works and that is all that we asked it for.
If the bird triggers the Key more than once before that the Thread woke up, the phone will take more than one picture and that is not cool.
But hey it's 7am and I am tired, don't think that I didn't put all the love that I have to give in it, because I did. 
And I don't regret anything, anything at all. 
Thank you so much, you've been an incredible friend bro, and no doubt we will continue to share amazing moment like that.

Best regards

Your faithfully
